- 👋 Hi, I’m @addIdeas, a finn, diving deep into the wonderous world of programmable computers.

- 👀 I’m interested in software development, programming and getting into the community of like minded people.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science in open university courses and applying to university to get a degree in the field.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects written in Java, since it's currently the one language I am most familiar with.

- 📫 How to reach me ... as for now try contacting via PM on github, I might add my personal contact information on a later date.
